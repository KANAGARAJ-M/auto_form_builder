@workspace i want to build

Name: auto_form_builder
Problem Solved: Most devs spend tons of time creating forms, validators, and controllers manually.

Features:

Create forms from JSON or Dart maps

Autogenerates TextFormFields, Dropdowns, DatePickers, etc.

Built-in validators (required, email, length, etc.)

Multi-step wizard support

Save/load draft from local storage

Dark/light mode ready

Support for custom widgets

Why It Will Be Popular:

Saves a lot of time for enterprise, form-heavy apps

Many Flutter devs build admin panels, onboarding flows, or data collection apps

Integrates well with Firebase, Supabase, etc.

Highly reusable in multiple apps
